## 0.3.2 - 2025-12-19

### Added
- Android: `CreateCalendarOptionsAndroid` for specifying custom account name when creating calendars
- `createCalendar()` now accepts optional `platformOptions` parameter for platform-specific configuration

## 0.3.1 - 2025-11-07

### Fixed
- `showEventModal()` now properly awaits until the modal is dismissed (iOS and Android)

## 0.3.0 - 2024-11-05

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `deleteEvent()` now requires named parameter `eventId` and always deletes entire series for recurring events
- **BREAKING**: `updateEvent()` now uses named parameter `eventId` (renamed from `instanceId`) and always updates entire series for recurring events
- **BREAKING**: Removed `deleteAllInstances` and `updateAllInstances` parameters - operations on recurring events now always affect the entire series
- Renamed `getEvent()` and `showEventModal()` parameter from `instanceId` to `id` to clarify that both event IDs and instance IDs are accepted

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: `NOT_SUPPORTED` error code (no longer needed)

## 0.2.0 - 2024-11-05

### Added
- `openAppSettings()` method to guide users to system settings when permissions are denied
- Testing status documentation in README

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: `getPlatformVersion()` method (unused boilerplate)
